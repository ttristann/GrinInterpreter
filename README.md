# Functional Programming Interpreter README

## Motivation
My motivation for embarking on this project stemmed from a desire to deepen my understanding of functional programming concepts introduced in class. Eager to put theory into practice, I sought an accessible outlet to hone my skills in functional programming.

## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform for practicing and executing functional programming commands. Frustrated with the limitations of existing online interpreters, I aimed to create a more intuitive and efficient solution for experimenting with functional programming concepts.

## Problem Solving
This project addresses the challenge of finding a suitable and user-friendly interpreter for functional programming. By consolidating functional programming commands into a single, accessible tool, users can avoid the hassle of navigating confusing online interpreters, streamlining the learning process.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of software development, including:
- Creating interpreters from scratch
- Efficiently managing the flow of algorithms in functional programming
- Implementing unit testing practices for robust development

## Unique Features
What sets this project apart is its focus on providing a user-friendly interface for functional programming enthusiasts. Additionally, there are limited options available for grin interpreters accessible to the public, making this project a valuable resource for those interested in functional programming.

## Getting Started
